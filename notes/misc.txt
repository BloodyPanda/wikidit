Problem statement:  Provide actionable advice for Wikipedia editors to improve articles.

What is Wikipedia? Collaboratively edited Encyclopedia


Why hasn't this been done yet?

- ORES (since 2014) has a predictive model
- Academic papers that provide black box models

Method

-  Data:

  - Current, articles only (~ 5 million articles)
  - All revisions (150 GB compressed)

-  Method

  - Balanced sample of ~ 30,000 articles for 6 quality classes
  - Outcomes: 6 categories of quality (FA, GA, B, C, Start, Stub)
  - Train classifier (Logistic, Random Forest, XGBoost)

- Interpretability

  - Local derivative
  - Effect of different within-article changes
  - Inverted regression: probability features given class

Next steps

-   Complete and polish interpretability portion
-   Train language model on sentences tagged POV, citation needed, weasel words

Prediction methods: Estimate the article quality given observed features

Actual task: What is the quality of the model after making a revision?

  - $E(y_i | x_i)$
  - $E(y_i | x_i + change x_i) - E(y_i | x_i)$
