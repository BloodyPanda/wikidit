As Prime Minister, Churchill led Britain to victory in the [[Second World War]]. Churchill represented five constituencies during his career as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP). Ideologically an [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] and [[British imperialism|British imperialist]], he began and ended his parliamentary career as a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which he led from 1940 to 1955, but for twenty years from 1904 he was a prominent member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\\n\\n<!--Early life and career prior to the Second World War-->\\nOf mixed [[English people|English]] and [[Americans|American]] parentage, Churchill was born in [[Oxfordshire]] to [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|an aristocratic family]]. Joining the [[British Army]], he saw action in [[British India]], the [[Anglo–Sudan War]], and the [[Second Boer War]], gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns. Elected an MP in 1900, initially as a Conservative, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In [[H. H. Asquith]]\\'s [[Liberal government, 1905–1915|Liberal government]], Churchill served as [[President of the Board of Trade]], [[Home Secretary]], and [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], championing [[Liberal welfare reforms|prison reform and workers\\' social security]]. During the [[First World War]], he oversaw the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]; after it proved a disaster, he resigned from government and served in the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1917 he returned to government under [[David Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]], and was subsequently [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Secretary of State for Air]], then [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]. After two years out of Parliament, he served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]\\'s [[Second Baldwin ministry|Conservative government]], returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the [[gold standard]] at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy.\\n\\n<!--Later life, the Second World War, and Cold War-->\\nOut of office during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the [[appeasement|growing threat]] from [[Nazi Germany]]. At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. Following Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]\\'s resignation in 1940, Churchill replaced him. Churchill oversaw British involvement in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, resulting in victory in 1945. His wartime leadership has been widely praised, however several of his decisions have proved controversial. After the Conservatives\\' defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Amid the developing [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]], he publicly warned of an \"[[iron curtain]]\" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. He was elected prime minister in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 election]]. His second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, including the [[Malayan Emergency]], [[Mau Mau Uprising]], [[Korean War]] and a UK-backed [[1953 Iranian coup d\\'état|Iranian coup]]. Domestically his government emphasised house-building and developed an atomic bomb. In declining health, Churchill resigned as prime minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964]].

This decision prompted Keynes to write \\'\\'The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill\\'\\', arguing that the return to the gold standard at the pre-war parity in 1925 (£1=$4.86) would lead to a global [[Great Depression|depression]]. However, the decision was generally popular and seen as \\'sound economics\\', although it was opposed by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] and the [[Federation of British Industries]].<ref>James, p. 207{{Incomplete short citation|date=March 2018}}</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill by Ambrose McEvoy.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Churchill by [[Ambrose McEvoy]] (1878–1927)]]\\n\\nChurchill later regarded this as the greatest mistake of his life; in discussions at the time with former Chancellor [[Reginald McKenna]], Churchill acknowledged that the return to the gold standard and the resulting \\'dear money\\' policy were economically bad.

The most affected was the coal industry, already suffering from declining output as shipping switched to oil. As basic British industries like cotton came under more competition in export markets, the return to the pre-war exchange was estimated to add up to ten percent in costs to the industry. In July 1925, a Commission of Inquiry report generally favoured the miners\\' position rather than that of the mine owners.<ref>Jenkins, p. 405</ref>\\n\\nWith Churchill\\'s support Baldwin proposed a subsidy to the coal industry, while a Royal Commission under [[Herbert Samuel]] prepared a further report.

He consulted the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Sir Douglas Hogg]], who advised that although he had a good case for [[criminal libel]], it would be inadvisable to have confidential Cabinet discussions aired in open court. Churchill agreed to let the matter drop.<ref>Gilbert, p. 173{{Incomplete short citation|date=March 2018}}</ref>\\n\\nLater economists, as well as people at the time, also criticised Churchill\\'s budget measures.

This meeting prompted Baldwin to comment that it was \"the time of year when midges came out of dirty ditches\". Neville Chamberlain was also taking a growing interest in foreign affairs, and in June, as part of a power-bid at the expense of the young and pro-League of Nations Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], he demanded an end to sanctions against Italy (\"the very midsummer of madness\").<ref name=\"auto1\">Charmley 1993, pp. 314–15</ref><ref name=\"auto\">James 1970, pp. 265–66</ref>\\n\\nIn June 1936, Churchill organised a deputation of senior Conservatives to see Baldwin, Inskip and Halifax.

Churchill\\'s figures for the size of the Luftwaffe, leaked to him by [[Ralph Wigram]] at the Foreign Office, were less accurate than those of the Air Ministry and he believed that the Germans were preparing to unleash [[thermite]] bombs \"the size of an orange\" on London. Ministers stressed that Hitler\\'s intentions were unclear, and the importance of maximising Britain\\'s long-term economic strength through exports, whereas Churchill wanted 25–30 percent of British industry to be brought under state control for purposes of rearmament. Baldwin argued that the important thing had been to win the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|election]] to get \"a perfectly free hand\" for rearmament. The meeting ended with Baldwin agreeing with Churchill that rearmament was vital to deter Germany.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\\n\\nOn 12 November, Churchill returned to the topic.

At this time, Churchill publicly gave his support to the King. The first public meeting of the Arms and the Covenant Movement was on 3 December.

Despite being partially paralysed down one side, he presided over a Cabinet meeting the next morning without anybody noticing his incapacity. Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill\\'s premiership would most likely have been over. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, Chartwell, to recuperate, and by the end of June he astonished his doctors by being able, dripping with perspiration, to lift himself upright from his chair.

From early on, his reputation as an unbending imperialist was well established. At the November 1921 cabinet meeting where a final decision on a proposal to retrocede [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]] to China was to be made, he, alone with [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Curzon]], another uncompromising imperialist, adamantly opposed the proposal, no matter how worthless the territory was known to be. He lamented Britain\\'s historic readiness to barter away places such as [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java]] and [[United States of the Ionian Islands|Corfu,]] asking \"Why melt down the capital collected by our forebears to please a lot of pacifists?\"<ref>Clarence B.

Historian Walter Reid, who has written admiringly about Churchill\\'s premiership and \"absolutely crucial role during the Second World War,\" has however acknowledged that Churchill \"was very wrong in relation to India, where his conduct fell far below his usual level.\" Reid further observes that while it remains \"tough to give a nuanced view on Churchill in a few words,\" Churchill\\'s efforts and those of several fellow back-bench parliamentarians in the 1930s to manipulate the 1935 Government of India Act further entrenched religious and political divisions amongst Hindus, Muslims and the Indian princely rulers.<ref name=\"Churchill_look_Raj\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/A-new-look-at-the-Raj/article16932292.ece|title=A new look at the Raj|publisher=The Hindu|first=Varma|last=Nikhil|date=23 December 2016}}</ref>\\n\\n===Cultural depictions===\\n{{Main|Cultural depictions of Winston Churchill}}\\nWinston Churchill has been regularly portrayed in film, television, radio and other media.
